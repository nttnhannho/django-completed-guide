I’m starting a new tutorial series about Django fundamentals. It’s a complete beginner’s guide to start learning Django. The material is divided into seven parts. We’re going to explore all the basic concepts in great detail, from installation, preparation of the development environment, models, views, templates, URLs to more advanced topics such as migrations, testing, and deployment.
